# step-by-step-to-implement-a-neural-network
step-by-step, implement a neural network with python and numpy to recognize handwritten number. I create tutorial to teach you backpropagation artifical neural network via a very simple toy example, a short python implementation.

artificial neural network is not magical nor difficult to understand, a toy example that you can play with could help you understand it easily, this work was done for an eassier understanding a neural network model!

todo:
1. more comments (about how to easily understand a BP ANN model and implemente one by yourself).
2. use other optimization algorithm (instead of pure gradient descent) in order to get faster train.
